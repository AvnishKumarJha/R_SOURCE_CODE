# R Programming Tutorial for Beginners #9


# Arithmetic operator
# Relational operator 
# Logical operator
# Assignment operator


# Arithmetic operator
# +,-,*,/,%%,%/%,^

#  %% -> remainder ke liye
#  %/% -> quotient ke liye
#  ^ -> Power ke liye

# Arithmetic Operator


a<-7.5
b<-2
print(a+b)     # Addition
print(a-b)     # Substraction
print(a*b)     # Multiplication
print(a/b)     # Division
print(a%%b)    # Remainder
print(a%/%b)   # Quotient
print(a^b)     # Powerof


# Vector 
# Arithmetic operation in vector

c1<-c(8,9,6)
c2<-c(2,4,5)
 
print(c1+c2)     # Addition
print(c1-c2)     # Substraction
print(c1*c2)     # Multiplication
print(c1/c2)     # Division
print(c1%%c2)    # Remainder
print(c1%/%c2)   # Quotient
print(c1^c2)     # Powerof


# Relational Operator
# <, >, ==, <=, >=, !=

# Output will be always be a TRUE or FALSE


# Relational operator

a<-7.5
b<-2
print(a<b)      #  Less Then
print(a>b)      #  Greater Then
print(a==b)     #  Equal to
print(a<=b)     #  Less then equal to
print(a>=b)     #  Greater then equal to
print(a!=b)     #  Not Equal to


# Vector 
# Relational operation in vector

c1<-c(8,9,6)
c2<-c(2,4,5)

print(c1<c2)      #  Less Then
print(c1>c2)      #  Greater Then
print(c1==c2)     #  Equal to
print(c1<=c2)     #  Less then equal to
print(c1>=c2)     #  Greater then equal to
print(c1!=c2)     #  Not Equal to


# Logical operator 
#  &  | ! &&  ||

d<-c(3.5,TRUE,2+5i)
e<-c(2.4,TRUE,6-5i)

print(d & e)
print(d | e)
print(!d)
print(d && e)
print(d || e)


# Assignment operator
# =, <-, ->, <<-, ->>
# <- Universal acceptance / Globally Acceptance
